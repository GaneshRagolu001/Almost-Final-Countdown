# **Countdown Challenge ⏳**  
A fast-paced timing game where precision and reflexes determine your success!  

## **About the Game 🎮**  
**Countdown Challenge** is an interactive timing-based game where players must click **"Stop"** before the countdown reaches predefined target times. The game becomes increasingly difficult as the levels progress, testing your ability to anticipate and react within split seconds.  

### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Multiple Difficulty Levels** – From beginner-friendly to expert-level precision.  
✅ **Unique Target Timings** – Carefully chosen to make stopping at the right moment challenging.  
✅ **Dynamic Feedback** – Visual and interactive cues to enhance gameplay.  
✅ **Engaging UI** – Smooth animations and an intuitive user experience.  

## **Tech Stack 🛠️**  
This project is built using **React**, with a strong focus on:  
- **State Management** – Efficient handling of game state, including countdown updates.  
- **Refs Usage** – Utilizing `useRef` for performance optimization and precise timing.  
- **Portals Implementation** – Managing overlays and modals for game interactions.  
- **React Hooks** – Leveraging `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for smooth gameplay.  
- **CSS Styling** – Clean and responsive design for an engaging experience.  

## **Why I Built This? 🤔**  
This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to **deepen my understanding of React**, specifically focusing on:  
✔️ **State management** and its role in handling game logic.  
✔️ **Refs** to control DOM elements without unnecessary re-renders.  
✔️ **Portals** for managing UI components that need to render outside the main DOM tree.  
✔️ **Other React concepts**, including hooks, event handling, and component structuring.  

## **How to Play? 🎯**  
1. Start the countdown by clicking the **"Start"** button.  
2. Click **"Stop"** before the timer reaches the target time.  
3. Your accuracy will determine your score!  
4. Progress through different levels, each with trickier target times.
